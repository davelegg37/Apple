		<div>NEXT</div>
		<div>The Apple and The Tree</div>
		<div>Back</div>
		<div>Listen</div>
		<div>There was once an apple that began to think.</div>
		<div>As it thought it became aware of itself, and as it became aware of itself it began to feel separate from the tree. It puzzled over the nature of the tree and concluded that the tree was simply an inert mass upon which it lived.</div>
		<div>Shortly after developing self awareness the apple began to experience another new phenomenon, problems.</div>
		<div>Falling off the tree and becoming seed for new trees, the natural thing for apples to do, worried this apple. When he fell off the tree he would not be an apple anymore, and thus he would loose his newly discovered self.</div>
		<div></div>
		<div>He could not face this thought. "Maybe I'm not like other apples," he thought. "Maybe I won't drop off the tree." This thought, although temporarily reassuring, never really put his fears to rest. Thus he devised a method to postpone his fall. He would simple demand that the tree give him a greater share of the nutrients.</div>
		<div>The tree had never encountered an apple such as this and dealt with it as it did all its other parts by giving what was needed. Thus the apple's demands were interpreted as its normal needs and readily granted. </div>
		<div>As a result of this cancerous relationship, the tree grew weaker and weaker.</div>
		<div>The apple's unhappiness was aggravated by still more problems. The apple, feeling no longer part of the tree, was faced with the problem of who it was. This rather unique question combined with his preoccupation with falling off the tree plunged the apple into a deep depression. </div>
		<div>To escape the depression he devised all sorts of gimmicks which he called play. Play, however, never worked for long, and as he grew bigger it failed all together. Soon play also became a problem.</div>
		<div>Meanwhile, the tree continued to meet the demands of the apple. These demands, however, were so great that it's ability to sustain a nutrient flow to the rest of its parts began to fail. It could no longer produce other apples, and its leaves and branches dried up and fell off. </div>
		<div>The apple was aware that something was wrong. It's demands failed to be met and the formally lush green surroundings of the tree began to disappear. It began to worry about this as well as it's other troubles and decided that it would be kinder to the tree. It began to phrase its wants as requests rather then demands.</div>
		<div>One day a wanderer in the orchard came upon something which puzzled him, a gnarled, dried up tree and beside it a gigantic, rotting apple.                                              The End</div>
